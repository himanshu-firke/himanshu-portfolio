## API Integration

The component attempts to fetch live stats from:
```
https://leetcode-stats-api.herokuapp.com/Himanshu-Firke01
```

If the API is unavailable, it falls back to placeholder stats. You can update these in the component.

## Customization

To update your LeetCode username, edit `LeetCode.tsx`:

```tsx
const username = "Himanshu-Firke01";
```

To update fallback stats, modify the catch block in the `fetchStats` function.
